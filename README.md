python session 2 
>python is programming language
>python is easy syntax
>python is a object oriented programming language(OOPS)
>python is a interpreted language
>python is platform independent language because of bytecode
>platform independent means we can run python in any os
>python supports large standard libraries for gaming, web development, machine learning, AI, Data science, data analytics
>eg:- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn etc....
>python is a case sensitive language
>i.e uppper case and lower case should be maintained properly
>It is a dynamicaly type language
>Because of there is no need to mention the data types
>Key words :-
>Key words are one reserved words each keyword has special meaning
>Don't use Keyword in variable name, function name etc...
>Eg:- False, None, True, and, as, assert, async, await, break, class,
>continue, def, del, elif, else, except, finally, for, from, global,
>if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or,
>pass, raise, return, try, white, with, yield
>Data types
>Each data types which is used store and manipulate different kinds of data
>List of data types
>int, float, bool, list, tuple, dictionary, string
>type() is an example of function
>it is used to find the data type of the variable or value
>Eg:- print(type("hello")
>     print(type(1))
>     print(type(2.5))
>     print(type(True))
>     print(type(False))
> String :-
>   String is a set a characters which is enclosed within double quotation("") or single quotation('') or Triple quotation(""" """).
>Eg:- print('hello')
>     print("hello")
>     print("""Hello world
>               python""")
>variable:-
> variable is a temporary storage area which is used to store a value
>syntax:- Variable = value
>           age    = 25
>Naming convention to create variable
>A variable name can be combination of alphabets, Numbers, underscore, symbol only.
>A variable name should not start with numbers
>give a meaningful name to the variable
>variable names are case sensitive eg:- name = 'hello' Name = 'hello', NAME = 'hello' 
>i.e upper case and lower case should ne maintained properly
>Do not use keywords for the variable name eg:- if="jayaprakash", else="Karthik"
> variable reintialisation :-
>           Maintain same variable name with different value is known as variable reintialisation
>Eg:- id=1
>     id=3
> while printing id 3 will be printed not the 1 because its overwrite the previous number
